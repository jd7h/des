The main goal of the robot is: find all three lakes and measure the temperature.

Functional requirements:
the robot must be able to
- wander the area
- recognize a lake and determine its color
- recognize the white barrier and not cross it
- notice obstacles in the area and avoid them while wandering
- lower the temperature sensor and measure the temperature in a lake
- see the difference between black, white, red, green and blue

usability:
the robot must
- not drive too fast, so that if the robot is heading for the edge of the table, the user still has time to interfere.
- provide feedback for the user about measurements it makes
- provide feedback for the user about the state of the program for debugging purposes

reliability:


performance:
- if the light sensors spot the white border, the robot must react immediately to avoid falling off the table.
- all three lakes must be found within a reasonable amount of time
- if the robot has already measured a lake, he must skip the measurements if he encounters that same lake again.

supportability:
